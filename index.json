Why is the secret ballot considered a democratizing reform in some settings, whereas in others it is associated with democratic backsliding? We provide theory and empirics to address these questions. Our starting point is the observation that the secret ballot had two consequences. It reduced the capacity to monitor the vote, thereby dampening the efficacy of clientelism. Yet, depending on literacy and electoral rules, it could also narrow political participation. Recognizing this, we endogenize politicians’ preferences over the secret ballot, concentrating on the role of their personal and constituency characteristics. Legislative roll call voting data from Brazil’s Second Republic (1945-1964) is used to test our framework. Consistent with expectations, the level of literacy of legislators’ supporters and the strength of their local ties strongly influenced the choice to adopt the secret ballot.","tags":[],"title":"Vote Secrecy with Diverse Voters","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1540526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1540526400,"objectID":"15d7cbe6c2753871ba330b5a278fe3a6","permalink":"https://dbmedeiros.github.io/talk/columbia2018/","publishdate":"2018-10-26T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/columbia2018/","section":"talk","summary":"Join the Brazilian Society at Columbia for a panel moderated by journalist Guga Chacra on the 2018 Brazilian Presidential elections.

The evidence gathered suggested that income inequality is strongly and positively correlated with political polarization. Preliminary data from Brazil, however, challenge the generalization of these findings. This paper assesses the reasons why this is the case. I argue that, if the president is endowed with considerable agenda-setting powers, the priority given to redistribution by the executive should determine the level of division within Congress. To appraise my argument, I explore the aforementioned relationship in democratic Brazil using state-level Gini coefficients and ideal points of the representatives from each state to the federal legislature. Given that in Brazil the states are the electoral districts, going local allows me to analyze how legislators react to changes in their constituencies. I hypothesize that (1) as income inequality decreases in a state over time, legislative polarization rises when redistribution is a priority in the presidential policy agenda, and (2) relative to other states, a state with higher levels of income inequality is more polarized, but this relationship is more pronounced when the president has a redistributive agenda. The paper contributes to the extant scholarship by bringing a developing country to the analysis and focusing on a crucial institutional feature.","tags":[],"title":"Space and Time in the Relationship between Income Inequality and Legislative Polarization: Evidence from Brazil","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Danilo Medeiros","Carol Mershon"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1479445200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1479445200,"objectID":"e94d9b2d377bca034e1aef35ab523396","permalink":"https://dbmedeiros.github.io/publication/gel2016/","publishdate":"2016-11-18T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/gel2016/","section":"publication","summary":"Under what conditions do legislative party leaders create an informal rule that conflicts with a formal one? We argue that legislators are relatively likely to adopt a new informal rule when they face particular types of changes in the legislature or in the legislature’s relationships with an external actor. Legislators are relatively likely to invent an informal rule at odds with a formal one both when a subset of them perceives a shift in the costs and benefits of formal institutions and when this subset, led by the most powerful among them, can coordinate on the informal rule. To appraise our argument, we compare two informal rules in the Brazilian legislature. By one informal rule, party switching in the Chamber of Deputies proceeded under formal rules intended to prohibit it. We also examine constitutional amendments gaining approval despite circumvention of the constitutional requirement that both houses of the legislature approve exactly the same reform. With Brazil providing our two in-depth cases, we close by briefly considering informal rules in Italy and Sweden.","tags":[],"title":"The Origins and Impact of Informal Rules: The Brazilian Legislature in Comparative Perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461729600,"objectID":"d1311ddf745551c9e117aa4bb7e28516","permalink":"https://dbmedeiros.github.io/project/external-project/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/external-project/","section":"project","summary":"An example of linking directly to an external project website using `external_link`.","tags":["Demo"],"title":"External Project","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

We analyze the probability of success and the duration of all bills sponsored by legislators in the Brazilian Congress since 1989. The goal of our analyses is to capture the effect of joining in the government coalition on the legislative performance of representatives. Today it is well documented that the legislative behavior of Congressmen is explained by party principles in Brazil. The President, whose legislative powers were enhanced by the 1988 Constitution, is in practice the agenda settler of the Congress. Yet we know little about what leads political parties to join the government coalition and support the President in Congress. Our study sheds light on a fundamental question regarding the governability under multiparty presidential systems: do participants of the coalition have greater success in approving bills? Depending on the answer, the advantage of being a member of the ruling coalition would not be just access to public jobs and government resources, it would rather be motivated by the benefit in producing public policies. We analyze the probability of success and the duration of all, over 30,000 bills sponsored by legislators in the Brazilian Congress since re-democratization to capture the effect of joining in the government coalition on the legislative performance. Our results indicate that the effect of integrating the government coalition in the chances of bill approval is conditional to the share os seats controlled by the party.","tags":[],"title":"Do Coalitions Matter?
